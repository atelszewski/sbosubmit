GENERAL:
- add possibility of invoking external editor for comment and keywords,
- implement --check-only, this requires:
  - setting warning/error flag in wmsg()/dmsg(),
  - is_error() can be removed or at least not used,
  - relaxed check of .info MAINTAINER and E-MAIL fields, i.e. do not check
    for particular values, but perform some basic checks,
  - SBOSUBMIT_SUBMISSION_EMAIL and/or submission e-mail passed on command line
    should not be required,
  - return 1 on error and 2 on warning,
- man: check what characters should be escaped, which are reserved, etc.,
- man: make URLs and e-mail work as links,
- extend ignored file list with TODO file name and issue a warning when
  submitting a SlackBuild while TODO is not empty,
- print submission archive md5 sum,
- .sbopkg management: give preference to files modified from within sbopkg,
  that is the ones with .sbopkg extension,

man:
- accommodate for 0dc6882 (Qt Creator generic project),
- accommodate for 4b4221c (tmp/ directory).

gentest:
- create test files that have correct values,
- create test files that have incorrect values,

main:
- check .info.PRGNAM against CWD,
- check .info.MAINTAINER against SBOSUBMIT_INFO_MAINTAINER,
- check .info.EMAIL against SBOSUBMIT_INFO_EMAIL,
- if possible, check .info.MD5SUM/MD5SUM_x86_64 against source tarball located
  in the SlackBuild directory,

.SlackBuild:
- check for #!/bin/sh on the first line,
- warn if Copyright not found,
- verify the order of variables appearance, e.g. first is PRGNAM, second is
  VERSION, etc.,
- extract PRGNAM,
- extract VERSION,
- extract TAG

OLD REGEX:
# ^PRGNAM=prgnam [# comment]

# ^TAG=${TAG:-tag} [# comment]
SLACKBUILD[TAG]=$(grep -m1 "^TAG=" "$FN" | sed -e 's/^TAG=${TAG:-\(.*\)}\(.*\)/\1/')

main:
- check .SlackBuild.PRGNAM against .info.PRGNAM,
- check .SlackBuild.VERSION against .info.VERSION,
- check for the .SlackBuild.author against SBOSUBMIT_SLACKBUILD_AUTHOR,
  this has to be found in the FIRST Copyright occurence,
- check for the correct .SlackBuild.year against current year,
  this has to be found in the FIRST Copyright occurence,
